Something interesting happens when a genome contains "ATGA"

Consider the following genome: ATGACCTGA
After splitting it to get its gene it looks like this: ATG ACC TGA
The gene starts after ATG, and ends before TGA, and it follows all the other rules of genes.
The problem is that a lot of methods of finding genes wouldn't work on this genome, 
because "ATGA" contains both "ATG" and "TGA", combined together.
So a method that would change "TGA" to "***" would also be getting rid of the "ATG" thats in "ATGA"

Here is another example: ATGCGATGACTTAA
This genome uses "ATGA" as both the ending and start of genes:
First gene: ATG  CGA  TGACTTAA
Second gene: ATGCGATG  ACT  TAA
The "TG" part of "ATGA" is used in both the ending of the first gene and the start of the second gene.
These are both valid genes that follow all the rules, so i believe they should be counter.
But the method that replaces gene endings with "***" would turn it into "ATGCGA***CT***". 
So it would only find the first gene.
